        <h3>What is an <strong>Electronic Cigarette</strong>?</h3>
        <p>An electronic cigarette (e-cig or e-cigarette), personal vaporizer (PV) or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) is a battery-powered vaporizer which simulates tobacco smoking by producing an aerosol that resembles smoke. It generally uses a heating element known as an atomizer, that vaporizes a liquid solution known as e-liquid.</p>

    <h5>Frequently Asked Questions:</h5>
    
    <ul>
        <li>How much is "vaping" like smoking?</li>
    <small>Very similar--enough to convince the most serious smokers. There are many reports of smokers with 1-2 pack a day habits completely switching over to e-cigarettes permanently. The vapor feels and looks like smoke. It delivers that instant nicotine satisfaction that smokers crave.
 </small>
         <li>Is it Safe?</li>
    <small>Tobacco smoke contains over 4,000 toxic chemicals. No actual smoke is involved with e-cigarettes only vapor. Smoke is the real health hazard. E-cigarettes deliver nicotine by inhaling a vaporized nicotine solution (composed of propolyne glyclol, vegetable glycerin and flavoring) without tar, carbon monoxide, flame retardants, pesticides, etc.​A report by the Royal College of Physicians states that nicotine by itself has not been proven to cause any long term ill health effects.Check out this recent study that compares cigarette by-products to e-cig by-products. It's amazing!</small>
         <li>How do I use an e-cig to quit smoking?</li>
    <small>E-cigs are not sold or marketed as stop-smoking aids. That is not a legal claim. You decide how an e-cig fits into your lifestyle. If you enjoy vaping more than smoking, well, we're happy for you! However, you can lower your nicotine strengths whenever you like.</small>
         <li>Are e-cigs and e-liquid approved by the FDA?</li>
    <small>The e-cigarette is a nicotine delivery device and does not fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA at this time. Electronic cigarettes are not banned or un-approved by the FDA.
</small>
         <li>Why are certain groups opposed to e-cigs?</li>
    <small>This is a complicated question. Certain groups may have a financial interest in attempting to capitalize on what is likely to be a billion dollar industry this year. Others are simply uninformed about electronic cigarettes and thus have an unfounded fear of them. This website will hopefully inform and enlighten many people about this smoking alternative.
 </small>
         <li>Can an e-cig be used anywhere?</li>
    <small>Technically, yes. There is no burning tobacco so no second hand smoke is produced. Although it is totally acceptable in most public places, there are certain areas like restaurants that may not like the appearance of it. In these cases simply check with the staff first. We wish to inform as many public facilities as possible so that electronic cigarettes will become acceptable in restaurants and other places that the general public frequents.Please be respectful of others' policies. Smoking has a bad enough reputation; we don't want that for vaping!</small>
